So the gui has all the buttons neccesary along with a save, start, pause, stop buttons

I'm not sure how to implement the start pause into it. Perhaps Paul can write something simple 
utulizing something built into Midi. I'm still a bit unsure about that. 


Because the files are all in the same folder, we should be able to access methods of different classes.
class.method() --> thats what I did in Gui. Once all the other pieces work, i should be able to test it
along with everything compiling properly.

some errors in the other files are causes problems to compile.

Once that is finished, I think connecting the gui will just be some polymorphism and that should be it.
